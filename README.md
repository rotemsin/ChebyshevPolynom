# ChebyshevPolynom
A Java program for Chebyshev polynom calculations

This Java program computes several calculations based on Chebyshev polynoms, a very important subject in Numerical Analysis. The program computes: the series of the 1st and 2nd kind, checking the equality of regular polynom to trigonometric polynom, calculating the roots of a Chebyshev polynom of the 1st and 2nd kind, calculating the extremas of a Chebyshev polynom of the 1st kind and more...
